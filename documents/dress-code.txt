COMPANY DRESS CODE

Company Dress Code

Prometric expects you to dress in a manner that represents you and the Company in the most favorable light. You are required to report to work in appropriate business attire during regular work hours, unless otherwise directed by your manager. "Appropriate" relates to the job you perform and the environment in which you work. If you work at the corporate office, appropriate attire includes a pair of slacks and a collared shirt for men (suits or ties are not required) and slacks or skirt and a blouse or sweater for women. If you are a "production" worker, appropriate attire includes clean pants or shorts and a shirt or sweater and footwear appropriate to the site. Prometric observes casual dress day each Friday. Prometric considers it inappropriate for you to come to work wearing such casual items of clothing as sweatpants, work-out clothing, shorts, mini-skirts or dresses, and clothing which is ill-fitting or revealing, torn, ragged or frayed. Should different attire be more suitable to your particular position, your manager will inform you what that attire should be.
